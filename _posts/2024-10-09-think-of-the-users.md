title: In Which I Beg You To Think Of The Users

I have never been satisfied by Technical Content.

In his remarkably enjoyable and insightful piece of Technical Content 
*Thinking Fast and Slow*, Nobel winning economist Daniel Kahneman claims:

> When faced with a difficult question, 
> we often answer an easier one instead, 
> usually without noticing the substitution.

This is what comes to my mind when I think of Technical Content and my experiences with it.
In particular my experiences trying to produce it.

---

Engineering is the process of dividing problems in half until they get too small to notice.

Is that true? Does it matter who said it?
I claim it is and and it is why everyone hates engineers.
But boy do they love what we create.

(Thank you Rizzo.)

This is where LinkedIn lacks threading and thus lost my default intent to post.

I feel like I am writing a run on sentence but Carry On Chaps We Are Going To Do This.

We Are Going To Create Technical Content.

---

My Technical Content will be Implicitly and Invisibly Threaded (tm) as befits us in this age of wonders.

---
 
I Digress. (also tm)

---

You might get mad about this one I dunno but 
all engineers really do is swap recipies. 

They get paid a tiny bit better than great chefs but 
more for the scarcity of their particular pallettes 
than anything particularly hard in comparison.

---

One aspect of this little index.html is that I am going to write it all by hand.

(I will have a similar log for voice notes and already have a standup vlog 
and that should be it really.)

I am vaguely aware that i might one day stich this together into a proper essay 
or otherwise make it better content but that day is not today.

I do like the idea of having a raw copy of what I actually typed
and I get the feeling it wont be long until I can do the rest by voice.

And uh if you want to read it just read it here 
finishing all this is not my priority.

I just want to start writing. And getting some feedback.

---

You see the answer real is never a straight line and it never divides evenly.

And technical writing should not be designed by the engineering mind of what the
engineer wants to naturally say and do and be attracted to.

That is called documententation and in this house we RTFM when required before asking.

Technical Writing should supplement an engineer's natural thinking with a complimentary voice.

That helps them exactly where they need it.

With pulling back.

Stitching together.

Re integrating leaky abstractions.

---

A few greats come to mind. Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky are not hard to find and may be
the top writers that inspired me coming up.

Paul Graham uses his voice in a way I greatly admire. But so does Elon Musk.

But these people draw me not because of the details of their craft. Although I too crave
those nuggets of insight that invariably fall from the tree of experience. But many do this well.
It is common.

But these are people who help me see how my work fits in the world.

What deeper patterns is it a part of.

Where I am slowing myself down and where I can speed myself up and have more fun in the process.

When I was at Uber I helped start the Eng Blog. It was what was called a "workcation" project
and we all did some admin stuff and some writing and rented a cabin in Tahoe and hung out for 
a week and I had a blast and I certainly tried hard to help and was a true believer. The guy 
who organized the trip (Conor Myhrvold lest that ever be in question) carried on when we got 
back and eventually he got it published with a lot of content created for that trip.

Now I don't want there to be any misunderstanding that there is only one villian in this story
and that is me.

But my piece never did get published. And I want to tell that story.

---

First our villian.

My primary sin is losing steam but villians are characters too and we are going to ask the question
why did I lose steam.

I lost steam first and foremost because what I was writing was not very good and I knew it.

I wonted to talk about animation and I had a three part series and the whole first part would be
written to an audience that would not care about Android, or Mobile, or Uber, but who 
Care About Humans.

And frankly I was nowhere near good enough to write it.

I am still not but I am enough better that I can see that much.

And I am good enough at writing software to have learned some humility.

But frankly I still have little interest in writing anything less.

It is a special kind of curse I hope I am never freed from.

It is hard for me to publish and put my name on anything that does not satisfy this critic.

---

I lost steam second and most interestingly because I was not supported.

I actually was supported as a human you all got the heart that story way wrong in my experience.

But I was not supported as a writer in this instict I describe.
And I am sure you know exactly the advice I was given instead.
As I am sure it is the same advice you have been given to death.
As I am sure that otherwise you would have closed this tab by now.

I know because this is what we do to each other, although I still don't really know why.
I have my suspicions but I do not let them distract from the facts that 
we are all afraid to try to say something real and new and different.

Something that might actually matter and might actually change someones mind.

Something worth remembering.

Especially at work where we may end up having to defend this to our boss or god forbid lawyers.

I do get it.

---

Frankly my only wish is that I had been good enough and if I was nobody would have stopped me.
But I was not and I was in my prime of being good in other ways so back to it then.
So it goes.

---

But here we are today and today I start again.

I have been writing a lot more in private and that has been good but I do have some thoughts and 
ideas I would like to share.

But I am going to take a stab at doing it on my time, on my dime, with no editor, in my way.

I want to do something that is both for myself but also meant to be shared.

I want to try to tell my story.

---

Actually I expect I will have an editor in due time but.
I am someone that reads the manual.
I also debug with printf.
This is the source.

---

The shape of emerging consciousness is story and that is the form my Technical
Content will largely take.

If that is not how you like to create then
I very well may not be the right teacher for you.

---

Some of you seem to have mastered a trick
of creating software in your minds.

I have never really written software in this way.
My mind contributes but, it is only one player in
a game and the main thing I do is pay attention
to the rules of the game and wait for the finished
product to emerge.

To me software has always evolved. 
First hello world. 
Then the world.

---

Software emerges from my desire to solve a problem.
A desire which is rooted in empathy.
An empathy which is rooted in experience.
An experience I felt in my body.
Likely frustration.
And decided I am going to change this.
Which is why I learned to code.
Which is why I am trying to learn how to write.

To beg you
to think of
the users.
